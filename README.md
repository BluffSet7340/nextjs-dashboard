## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

I am following the tutorial from Next.js foundational course to build a fullstack application: a financial dashboard.

### Chapter 1 - 5

This covered the initial introduction and the directory structure of the average next.js project. I learnt about adding custom css modules and/or using tailwind css to style elements. Within that I learnt about clsx, which styles elements based on certain conditions - green if customer paid, grey is payment is pending. Most importantly I learnt about how routing between pages occurs. This requires the layout.tsx and page.tsx. The former is needed to share UI components across pages - an example is sharing the side nav bar. The latter is needed to make the route accessible and only the components included in the page.tsx file are made accessible to the user.
